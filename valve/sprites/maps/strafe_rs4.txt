Rs4 starts the second trilogy of my strafe map series. Again im 
bringing you new fresh ideas combined with awesome toon theme. As 
usual, ten jumps of medium difficulty are awaiting brave strafers. 
This time look carefully around, you might find some secrets during 
your journey. I hope ending bonus part will be a nice surprise for 
those who like... oh yeah, i wont spoil :) It was one of the nicest 
maps i had a chance to make, and i've enjoyed it a lot, hope so you 
will too by playing it :D
