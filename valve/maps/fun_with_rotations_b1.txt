[ - Fun With Rotations - Strafe jumps on rotating objects - ]

Objective: Finish the 11 jumps to beat the map.
There are 5 secrets (2 obvious, 3 hidden)
There are two teams; Rotatoes and Hardcore Rotatoes.

This is a sequel to fun_with_ladders. Due to complaints about my last map not being fun enough i made this one even worse.
Have fun
