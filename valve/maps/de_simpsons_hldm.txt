map by soup
orginal readme included in zip

this is the same map made by soup with just the cs entities removed
and weapons ammo and spawns added for dm gameplay. the map rocks 
too bad soup never made a dm version :( . 

only real problem is that you can get into areas you wouldnt be
able too if you were playing cs. if you go into these areas you
will have no way to get out. this is mainly the area in back of the house 
and the side on the other side of the bus.
