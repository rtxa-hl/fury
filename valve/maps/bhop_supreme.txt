A very hard bhop/climb map to test your skills.

Standard Team: 
- Has checkpoints to make the map easier.
Hard Team:
- No checkpoints, all jumps must be done first try.
Long Jumper Team: 
- Gain access to the long jump bonus area only.

All long jumps up to 294 have been done as civilian at 100 fps.
Long jumps are not meant to be prehopped to gain speed. They are
meant to be done in one consecutive jump with a prestrafe.

If you can jump 290 or more, very nice!
