Map by rSnake, August 2010


Long time since my last map was released. Due to small amount of my 
free time i cant map as much as i would wish to. But well, here it is,
third strafe map in the rs series. This time you can choose your level 
of difficulty from easy, medium and hard. For each section you can get 
some points and... a reward. No bonus jumps, no secrets this time due 
to huge amount of ents used, sorry.
