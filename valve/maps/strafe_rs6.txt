Purple highlights and blue stripes! This intermediate map may give some trouble 
even to experienced strafers. Do i care? Not really cos im shit yet i can do all 
of the jumps lol. Try harder. 9 jumps of rather increasing difficulty, huge bonus 
and a special jump. Enjoy the sixth installment in the serie!
