Map by rSnake, April 2011


This time its based on bhopping but not only, some blocks are supposed
to just being run by, including strafe motives and ramps. 9 jumps of 
rather increasing difficulty and a crazy bonus that will blow your eyes.
Look around for some secrets too :) This map aims for details and beauty 
thats why some jumps may get crowded easily. Be patient and take turns,
use the Observation Areas to check out how other players are doing the 
map or just sit on the bench and watch. Have fun!
