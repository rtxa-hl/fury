Comments: The frag pipe has a couple of "sweet" spots and if you want you can stand there all day if you like... 
or take your medicine. The aquarium room was built before I realized that you can`t put monsters in deathmatch levels and I have no idea
why there is no noise when your walking through the water; for some reason it has to be about knee high to make sloshing noises(????). 
For quicker access to the doors and elevators I made them touch only(not use). If you for any reason you should wish to use any
idea or any part of this creation YOU MUST HAVE PERMISSION!!! Also please e-mail if you`ve any questions or comments regarding this map or any
future or past endeavors. Anyone wishing to possible work on a map pak should also contact me at the appropiate address(serious inquiries only please).



Special Thanks to Satanas for his help testing this map.

ATTN-REVIEWER: Please include in the review the location of the bug gun(elevator shaft B) , the illusionary wall in the "window room", and the secret area triggered by the computer for those not using
decals.
