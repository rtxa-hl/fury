A medium strafemap for advanced strafeskill perfection.
If you are not able to beat this map after a few tries,
you should play and complete strafe_easy first.


Have fun, good luck!!

Thanks to all people who played strafe_easy and
inspired me to create this map!

Special thanks to Bolleh for textures!

Thanks to Poon for beeing a good friend!
