watertight doors are closing. You have to fight for your life, 
escape from the sinking ship.

Important notes:
It should be possible to finish first part with at least 2 persons 
and second part with at least 3. Also keep in mind that some of 
the places or rooms could never existed in real or be way different.

Many of the interior and exterior parts are based on the movie, 
wikipedia and a model of the ship, which i own.



Have fun playing the map!
