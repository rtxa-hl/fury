STORY
		After Gordon defeated Nihilanth, the door for colonization of Xen 
	was thrown open.  Earth soldiers used the teleportation technology gained from 
	the Black Mesa Research Facility to warp into Xen and secure sections of it. 
	Bases were built in the conquered territory, but they were under the constant
	threat of counter-attack by the native Xen.  
		You were sent to a communications outpost near the front lines, 
	along with a large group of civilian and military workers.  As the fighting raged
	on, the outpost grew increasingly closer to the advancing Xen army.  After 
	heavy fighting, the Xen army cut off the outpost from any ground resupply, and 
	any ships coming in were destroyed.  The outpost was too difficult for the Xen 
	to take, so instead they were going to starve the humans out.  
		Once the base was cut off, supplies began to run low.  A few of the
	soldiers stole the only way out, the cargo ship, and escaped, leaving the 
	rest, including you, to die.  As the supplies dwindled, fighting soon erupted 
	between the humans.
		The Earth forces soon began a counter-attack of their own, and tried
	to relieve the outpost and save those left.  But as the battle between Earth and 
	Xen raged around them, the survivors in the outpost continued their slaughter...
	
DESCRIPTION
		This is a smallish map that is good for 2-8 players.  Any more will 
	cause the map to degenerate into a giant pistol/crowbar fight on the ground level.
	This map is mainly a bunch of interconnected halls and stairways surrounding a 
	large open area.  The r_speeds never go above 450, and they only reach 450 in 
	only two places.  There is a large amount of weaponry spread out throughout the
	level, but the ammo is placed to force people to move around.  It is almost impossible
	to camp out anywhere.
		I didn't include all the weapons, since I didn't think they would fit.  
	Snarks, the HornetHand, and the Egon were not included, and there are only one
	each of the RPG, the Gauss, and the Crossbow.

ADDITIONAL INFO
		This is my first released map, so be afraid >:)  I've been mapping 
	since I got Half-Life in December 1998.  I've made a bunch of maps previously 
	that all failed because of the usual newbie shortcomings.  Since I didn't want to 
	release a substandard map, I never released them, which is a good thing.  Don't
	worry though, I've made every mistake in the book and have finally made a map 
	that does not have any of those early errors.  So enjoy!
		Please email any comments, suggestions, rants, or complaints to me at
	YakFighter@aol.com or Yak_Fighter11@hotmail.com.  I enjoy reading all of it!
