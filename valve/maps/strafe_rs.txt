Bonus jump by N.O.L.F.


Well, a simple, not too hard and ofcourse my first strafe map. Consist 
of 10 jumps of rather increasing difficulty (except 9). Good to train 
your strafe abilities, also speedrun challenge for intermediate and 
advanced strafers. Have fun playing it!

I'd like to thanks N.O.L.F. for his awesome strafe maps that
inspired me to create this one.
