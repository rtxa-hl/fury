A strafemap for beginners to train the first steps of advanced movement.
If you're good enough to finish this map, or maybe just want to try a different
one you might wanna try out my other strafemaps called strafe_easy and strafe_medium.
The bonusjump is taken of my map STROLF.

10 Jumps + 1 Bonus

Have fun, good luck!!


Thanks to all people who played and liked my other maps and
therefore inspired me to create this one!

Special thanks to -->!!__MIKE__!!<--, Sslady, Ariin, Nerdlike, Mccarf, Wubwub and Leandros for playtesting.

Map by N.O.L.F. (04.20.2010)

Explanation:

1. Strafing

The movements are usually as follows:

   1. The player presses the forward key, preparing to make the first jump.
   2. Still keeping the forward key pressed, the player jumps, adding
      either the move left or the move right key 
      (which is where the strafe in strafe-jumping comes from). The strafe
      and jump keys must be pressed at the same time.
   3. To gain maximum speed, the player must now move the mouse smoothly to
      around a 45 degree (i.e., turn) in the direction
      of the strafe, while still holding down the two aforementioned keys.
      This part is called airstrafing, which is responsible for increase in speed during the jump.
   4. For successive strafejumps, the player immediately jumps again on landing,
      swapping the direction of strafe as well as mouse motion.

2. Bunny hopping

Bunny hopping, or bunny jumping, is a term used in video games to
describe the basic movement technique in which a player jumps
repeatedly instead of running in order to move faster and/or to avoid enemy fire.

3. Ladders

To achieve higher height on ladders face the wall left or right to the ladder
and look completly up or down. Now hold down the strafe key facing the ladder
and additionally forward(if looking up), or backward(if looking down).
